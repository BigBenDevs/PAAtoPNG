# PAAtoPNG
Convert PAA files to PNG

This program utilizes the Bohemia Interactive program Pal2PacE.exe to convert PAA images into PNG format.  

The application REQURIES Arma 3 tools installed on the PC.  

Step 1: Located and select Pal2PacE.exe using the PATH button.  Pal2PacE will be located inside the Arma 3 tools
directory in the Textview2 folder.

Step 2: Select a folder that conatins PAA files you wish to convert to PNG.  The application does not currently have
functionality to convert individual files, so it will be grabbing every PAA in the selected directory

Step 3: Select the destination path you would like the converted files to be sent to.  


NOTE:  Save checkboxes do not currently update.  It's on the TODO list.
